Thanks for your interest in contributing to Aletheia. Whether you want to fix bugs, add features, improve the GameDB, or help with translations, contributions are welcome.

### GameDB

Game titles are based on GOG names, but titles from Steam and itch.io are also accepted. The following placeholders can be used:
